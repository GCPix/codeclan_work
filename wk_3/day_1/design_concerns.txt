design concerns

1 back end code independent of front end
2. Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Persist Data

Models hold business logic ie classes so 1 above

Controller
links model and view.
on initialisation the model will check what it needs to do, ie load images, counts etc.  The controller then 'injects' this into the view


Views
HTML documents, so funnily enough what people see

CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete

type psql to access
